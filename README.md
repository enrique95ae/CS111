# CS111

This repo contains all of the HW assignments for CS111.  
This is an introductory class to coding and C++, please do not assume any of this is either correct or the best way of solving each problem.   
Feel free to use this as help but not as your own work.  
All the assignments where done in the main.cpp. There is no classes or multiple file programs so all the .cpp are in the main folder of the repo.
A list of the HW assignments as well as a brief description is available towards the end of this file.
